              <h1>- About Me -</h1>
              <p>I'm Ruth, a developer with a background in design. After taking time to raise my three kids, I returned to the workforce six years ago. Since then, I've been focused on learning and developing my skills in technology.
                I enjoy solving problems and bringing creative solutions to the table. My design background gives me a unique perspective, which I bring to my development work.
                I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and learn more, and I thrive in collaborative environments. Outside of work, I stay motivated by participating in a mum's netball team and enjoying running.
                I'm excited to continue my journey in tech and collaborate on meaningful projects.
